  notes: 'This refers to hair from the neck down. For example, "arm hair" is {DeS
    pob:n@@DeS:n:1, pob:n}. It is also used to talk about ear hair or nose hair. Using
    this word to refer to facial hair (see {rol:n} and {loch:n}) or head hair (see
    {jIb:n}) is possible, but would be considered very strange to do.[2]


    This word can also be used for animals to refer to their body hair or fur.[3]'
