  notes: 'This is a rare and dangerous resource which is found on the sacred planet
    of {bo''retlh:n}. Touching one induces visions of the future, and removing one
    requires a great sacrifice. It can be used as a power source in time-travel technology.


    To Klingons outside of {bo''retlh:n}, time crystals were a myth, a symbol of Kahless,
    and the namesake of {Qo''noS:n}.'
  hidden_notes: In Greek philosophy, "Chronos" is the personification of time. If
    time crystals are the namesake of {Qo'noS:n:nolink}, then the similarity to the
    planet's name is not a coincidence.
