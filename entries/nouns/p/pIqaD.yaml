  notes: Little is known about how {pIqaD:n:nolink} works, except that it is not an
    alphabet.[2]
  hidden_notes: 'If interpreted as a sentence, {pIqaD:sen@@pI-:v, qaD:v} literally
    means "we challenge you".


    Prior to {DSC:src}, the {pIqaD:n:nolink} seen in the shows, movies, and videogames
    were arranged based on aesthetics and had no relation to the language. This allowed
    the costume and set designers to freely create decorative text and reuse templates.
    Some of the same sequences of symbols were even used to mean different things
    in different contexts. In {DSC:src}, both within the show itself and in promotional
    posters and videos released prior to its debut, Klingon is written in {pIqaD:n:nolink}
    treating the symbols as an alphabet. The mapping between the twenty-six symbols
    and Okrand''s Latin transcription has a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correspondence
    (e.g., so that {tlh:sen:nolink} is written as one symbol), and originated from
    an unknown source at Paramount and was popularised by the Klingon Language Institute.
    There is no official explanation for why {pIqaD:n:nolink} appears to be an alphabet
    in {DSC:src}.'
