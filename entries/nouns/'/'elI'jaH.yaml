    This was revealed to a small group in 2006 at {qep''a'' 13:src}, but only posted
    to the mailing list in 2007. It was written by Okrand in {''ISqu'':n:name}''s
    notebook, and under it Lawrence Schoen had copied down the definition as "unexpected
    visitor". The notebook was shown to {Qov:n:name} at {qep''a'' 14:src}, after which
    she posted it to the mailing list misspelled as {''el''I''jaH:n:nolink} with the
    misremembered definition "uninvited guest". The glosses "uninvited guest" and
    "unexpected guest" which appear in some word lists seem to be based on word-of-mouth
    transmission, and the written definition in {''ISqu'':n:name,nolink}''s notebook
    has been taken as authoritative here.'
