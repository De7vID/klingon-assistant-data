  notes: 'This is a planet which has become part of the Klingon Empire. On this planet,
    a dialect of Klingon has all but replaced any languages originally spoken.[2,
    p.17]


    In the Morskan dialect, {tlh:sen:nolink} at the end of a syllable is pronounced
    like "ts" (like in "cats"), while at the beginning it is pronounced like {ghl:sen:nolink}.
    {H:sen:nolink} at the beginning of syllables is pronounced like "h" (like in "hat"),
    while it is not pronounced at all at the ends of syllables. {Q:sen:nolink} at
    the beginning of syllables is pronounced the same as a standard {H:sen:nolink}.[2,
    p.22]


    The Morskan dialect does not put the suffix {-''e'':n:suff} on the subject noun
    in a "to be" sentence. When it is present, it serves its usual focusing function.[2,
    p.24]'
  hidden_notes: The Morskan dialect is featured in {Star Trek VI:src}, in a scene
    involving border guards on the way to {rura' pente':n}.
