  notes: This can also be written as {morwI' ghew:n@@morwI':n, ghew:n}. It is the
    closest Klingon equivalent to an ant, based on appearance. The Klingon version
    is noted for its dexterity or agility, hence the name (see {mor:v}), and not for
    its strength. But Klingons use this term for the Terran ant anyway.[1]
  hidden_notes: 'The Proto-Indo-European word for ant is reconstructed as "*morwi-".


    The request was for "ant(s), formicidae" with the plural in brackets, and the
    answer was given as two possibilities, {morwI'', morwI'' ghew:sen:nolink}.'
