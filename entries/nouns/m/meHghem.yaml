  notes: 'There is no single word for "art" or "artwork", in the sense of individual
    pieces of visual art (painting, sculpture, etc.).


    {meHghem:n:nolink} is a bigger, more comprehensive term covering "the arts" or
    "art" as opposed to "science". It includes music, theater, dance, etc., as well
    as visual art. It''s "culture" in this sense.'
