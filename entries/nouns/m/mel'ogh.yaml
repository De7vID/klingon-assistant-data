  notes: This refers more generally to anything on its way to becoming something else.
    For example, it could be used for a lump of clay being transformed into a pot
    (but is not yet a pot). As slang, it could refer to a student or athlete or warrior
    in training, but not yet up to speed, as it were.[1]
  hidden_notes: Backwards of "golem", which is a Hebrew word meaning "pupa", but also
    referring to a mythological creature created from clay.
