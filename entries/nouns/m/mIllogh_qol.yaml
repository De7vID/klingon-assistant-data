  notes: 'This refers to animation only, and not to printed cartoons in the newspaper.[1]
    Even though {qol:n:1h} refers to a multitude of things, they are being treated
    as a collection, so one would say {qolmey:n@@qol:n:1h, -mey:n} for multiple cartoons.[2]


    To refer to a non-animated cartoon, see {mIllogh mIr:n} and {mIllogh meyrI'':n}.'
  hidden_notes: At the Q & A session at {Saarbrücken qepHom'a' 2021:src}, it was explained
    that {qol:n:1h,nolink} is a noun, but its meaning was not revealed then. The meaning
    was subsequently revealed in the booklet, which was published later.[2]
