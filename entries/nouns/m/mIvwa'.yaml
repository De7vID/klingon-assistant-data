  notes: 'This is a scar which is the result of a wound (regardless of how the wound
    occurred).[1] A scar that results from surgery is a {mIvwa'':n:nolink} and not
    a {roptoj:n:nolink}.[3]


    A tally or score is kept by counting {mIvwa''mey:n@@mIvwa'':n, -mey:n}. This is
    also used for "census" or "headcount".[2]'
  hidden_notes: 'This was defined as just "scar", with an accompanying explanation
    of the kinds of scars.[1]


    The appropriate word for a surgery scar was explained during the Q & A session
    at {Saarbrücken qepHom''a'' 2021:src}.[3]'
