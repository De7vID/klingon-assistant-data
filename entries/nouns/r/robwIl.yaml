  notes: This can be the object of {naj:v} "dream" or {SIQ:v} "endure" and some other
    verbs, but generally not {ghaj:v} "have" (unless you somehow literally possess
    a nightmare).
  hidden_notes: 'William Shatner played a character named Robert Wilson in the Twilight
    Zone episode "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet".


    One of the tracks on the Robin Williams comedy album "Reality... What a Concept"
    is named "Shakespeare (A Meltdowner''s Nightmare)", but this is probably a genuine
    concidence.'
