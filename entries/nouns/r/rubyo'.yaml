  hidden_notes: 'Possibly a reference to a specific politician, though the resemblance
    might just be a genuine coincidence.


    The original request wasn''t neutral: "A person who is professionally involved
    in politics. Also a derogatory term for a person who manipulates or pleases others
    just to gain own advantage. For example, Gowron is described as a politician in
    DS9." Based on this, it seems the term may be used in a derogatory manner, to
    mean something like "political careerist" or "political opportunist".'
