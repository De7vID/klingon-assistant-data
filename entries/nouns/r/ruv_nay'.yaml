  notes: Klingons don't traditionally have a sweet dessert at the end of a meal. This
    term has been heard for "dessert" in the way Terrans think about it.
  hidden_notes: 'Maltz didn''t understand why it was called this, but guessed someone
    must have misunderstood something and mistranslated.


    In the phrase "just deserts", referring to a deserved punishment or outcome, the
    word "deserts" is pronounced like (and often confused with) the word "desserts".'
