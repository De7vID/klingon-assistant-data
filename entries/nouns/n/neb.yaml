  definition: nozzle
  see_also: '{neb:n:1}'
  notes: This word refers to nozzles on rockets, hoses, etc., and takes the plural
    suffix {-mey:n}, as the connection to the body part has been lost.[1] (This is
    an exception to the general pattern of words for body part retaining the suffix
    {-Du':n} when they are used to refer to other things, as the non-body-part meaning
    of this word has become lexicalized.[2])
