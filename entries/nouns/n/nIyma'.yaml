  notes: This refers to something that seems to appear, but isn't really there. It
    does not refer to a ghost or spirit, and is quite different from {qa':n}.
  hidden_notes: This refers to a {Saarbrücken qepHom'a':src} participant named "Nima"
    who never showed up. Also, in German, "niemand" means "nobody".
