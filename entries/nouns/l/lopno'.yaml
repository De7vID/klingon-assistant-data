  notes: This is an event to which the spirits of ancestors are invited.[2]
  hidden_notes: The gloss in {KGT:src} says simply "party, celebration". The definition
    has been changed for clarity based on the information from {KCD:src}. In {KCD:src},
    Vok says, "The celebration was declared a {lopno':n:nolink}. You have invited
    all the spirits of our Klingon ancestors." This suggests that a {lopno':n:nolink}
    is a type of party or celebration, rather than a specific event.
