  notes: This is a disease caused by a bacterium. Its symptoms include high fever,
    weakness, and perhaps abdominal pain, headaches, and a skin rash. Klingons tend
    to avoid talking about it.[1]
  hidden_notes: 'This was requested as a native Klingon equivalent for typhoid fever.


    Probably a coincidence: Lieven Lemnes was the author of "Diseases: Their Symptoms
    and Cures".'
