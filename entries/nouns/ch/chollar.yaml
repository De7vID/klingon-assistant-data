  hidden_notes: 'Maltz was wrong earlier and there is a Klingon bow-and-arrow type
    weapon used in the past, in addition to modern bows and arrows borrowed from or
    modeled on those of other cultures. This word refers to a traditional form of
    arrow.[1]


    This was defined only as "arrow", with an explanation. The annotation "(weapon)"
    was added for clarity.'
