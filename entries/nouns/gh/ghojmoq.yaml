  hidden_notes: This word was made up by the writers for {TNG - Sins of the Father:src}
    to refer to Kahlest, who was Worf's childhood nurse. It appears in the script
    as "ghojmoK" (sic). It's likely the writers just looked up various words in {TKD:src}
    related to childcare, came upon {ghojmoH:v}, and changed the ending (either deliberately
    to create a different word, or by accidentally miscopying "H" as "K"). It was
    subsequently made official in the Appendix to {TKD:src} as {ghojmoq:n:nolink}.
