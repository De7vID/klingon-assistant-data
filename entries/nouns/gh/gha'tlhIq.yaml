    In the list of vocabulary used in {KCD:src} which was given to the KLI in advance
    (and printed in {HQ 5.1:src}), this was defined as "GaTH''K, Ode of respect",
    but this transliteration appears nowhere else in Okrand''s works.[3] (However,
    it is used in the novelisation of the game.)'
