  notes: This refers to a device which dissipates heat.
  hidden_notes: Some people believed early on that this was a mistake for {tlhuchwI':n:nolink}
    (see {tlhuch:v}). However, {tuj ghImwI':n} actually makes sense for a mechanism
    that dissipates heat, and subsequently revealed information on {ghIm:v} shows
    that it is correct.
