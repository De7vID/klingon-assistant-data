  notes: This word refers to an infant, and should not be used in addressing an adult
    (unless the intention is to insult). Unlike in Federation Standard, calling someone
    "baby" in Klingon is not a sign of affection.
  hidden_notes: This is probably the sound a Klingon baby makes. Also, "goo".
