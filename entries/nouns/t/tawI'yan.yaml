  notes: Klingon counterpart (more or less) of the "best man" at a wedding. This is
    normally translated as "sword-bearer", but etymologically that's not quite right.
    It's a frozen and somewhat modified form of an old word which was apparently something
    like {taywI'yan:n:nolink}, having something to do with ceremony or ritual {tay:n:2}
    and sword {yan:n}, but the details of the old grammatical construction are unknown.[1]
