  notes: This is said during the ritual of discommendation ({naDHa'ghach:n}). The
    usual way to say "coward" is {nuch:n}.
  hidden_notes: 'According to the script for {TNG - Sins of the Father:src}, Worf
    says {tlhIH ghIj jIHyoj:sen@@tlhIH:n, ghIj:v, jIH:n:1, yoj:n}, which is not grammatical,
    but is supposed to mean "I fear your judgment". K''mpec then replies with {bIHnuch:sen:nolink}.
    It is reasonable to assume that these two phrases are archaic and ritualised.


    It''s likely that these sentences were made up by a writer who consulted {TKD:src},
    as they contain existing words, but did not have an understanding of Klingon grammar.'
