  definition: drill (device)
  notes: This refers to the entire device, not just the drill bit. This is often shortened
    to {voD jan:n}.
  hidden_notes: This is defined as "drill". The word "device" was added to disambiguate
    this from (and to be consistent in appearance with) {qeq:n} "drill (military)".
