  notes: When used as a locative, this word is not followed by the locative suffix
    {-Daq:n:suff}.[3]
  hidden_notes: MO was asked whether {vogh:n:nolink} can be used as a locative (without
    {-Daq:n:suff}) at {qep'a' 22 (2015):src} ({KLI mailing list 2015.08.05:src}).
    He answered that it probably could but wasn't sure and had to check. Subsequently,
    he confirmed this at {qep'a' 24 (2017):src} ({KLI mailing list 2017.07.30:src}).
