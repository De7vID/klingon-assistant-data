  definition: back (exterior surface)
  notes: 'This is an extension of {Sa''Hut:n:1} to the back of something, in which
    case the front would be {logh''ob:n:2} and the sides would be {reD:n:3}.[1] In
    this usage, the plural is formed with {-mey:n:suff}.[2]


    This can apply to cars, motorcycles, space ships and the like, but not to the
    back of a computer screen (too flat) or a bottle (because it''s round). There''s
    an overlap with {''o'':n}, but whereas {''o'':n:nolink} refers to a 3-dimensional
    space, {Sa''Hut:n:2,nolink} refers to the surface at the back.[3]'
  hidden_notes: 'An explanation of {logh''ob:n:2,nolink}, {Sa''Hut:n:2,nolink}, and
    {reD:n:3,nolink} was given during the Q & A session at {Saarbrücken qepHom''a''
    2021:src}.


    This was defined as "back". The clarification "exterior surface" was added based
    on the explanation.'
