  notes: 'This means "variety" in the sense of "an interesting variety of tea", not
    "variety is the spice of life".[2]


    When the verb {Sar:v} is used adjectivally, it usually follows a plural noun.
    It can follow a singular noun, but this is unusual and would probably have to
    be made clear by context.[2] Thus, {tamler Sar:n:nolink} means "isotope" (i.e.,
    a variety of the same element) and not "various elements" (i.e., different elements),
    which would be {tamlermey Sar:n@@tamler:n, -mey:n, Sar:v}.[3]'
  examples: '

    ▶ {Hol Sar:n}

    ▶ {QIch wab Ho''DoS Sar:n}

    ▶ {Sep Hol Sar:n}

    ▶ {tamler Sar:n}'
