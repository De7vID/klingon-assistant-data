  notes: This is a type of small person in Klingon mythology, like an elf or a gnome.[1]
    It might be used to translate creatures such as "dwarf" or "fairy" in Terran mythology
    as well, though it might not be appropriate for translating the term "fairy tale".[2]
  hidden_notes: The information that it can also be used to translate "dwarf" or "fairy"
    was not posted to the mailing list at the time it was revealed. It surfaced in
    a later discussion about translating The Wizard of Oz.
