  notes: 'This is a kind of surrogate parent role which is bestowed on a family friend
    who would care for a child if their parents were incapacitated. The closest analogy
    for the relation between a soh-chim and a child''s parent is a stepbrother or
    stepsister.[2]


    This term is gender-neutral and "godparent" is a good approximation. If a gender
    distinction needs to be made, {loD:n} or {be'':n} can be added after {So''chIm:n:nolink}.[3]'
