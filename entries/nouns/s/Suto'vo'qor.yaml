  notes: The afterlife for the honored dead, where all true warriors go after they
    die to fight an eternal battle. The closest Klingon equivalent to heaven.

    confirmed by MO at {qep''a'' 17 (2010):src}.


    The way this word has appeared in English has been inconsistent between whether
    hyphens or apostrophes separate the three parts, and whether each part is capitalized.
    It''s written "Sto-Vo-Kor" on {TKW p.144:src}, the script to {TNG - Rightful Heir:src},
    and in {Diplomatic Implausibility:src}, which is the convention followed here.
    However, it has also been spelled "Sto''Vo''Kor" and "Sto-vo-kor" in some materials.
    The latter way appears in the {paq''batlh:src}.'
