  notes: '{HoSDo'':n:nolink} may have formerly been {HoS Do'':n@@HoS:n:1, Do'':n:1}.
    This may perhaps be translated as something like "swarm of energy," with the notion
    of "lifeforms" or "beings" (in this case non-corporeal) implicit in the meaning
    of {Do'':n:1}, but it is now considered a single inherently plural noun.[2]'
  hidden_notes: One energy being is a {HoS Dep:n@@HoS:n:1, Dep:n}.
