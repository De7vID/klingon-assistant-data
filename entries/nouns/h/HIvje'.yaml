  hidden_notes: 'This was defined as "glass (tumbler)" in {TKD:src} (presumably to
    clarify that it doesn''t refer to the material).[1] On {KGT p.78:src}, it was
    explained that this word refers to "a drinking glass of any kind (a goblet, tumbler,
    wineglass, mug)". On {KGT p.98:src}, this word is said to be used for "any sort
    of drinking vessel: glass, cup, mug, stein, goblet, tumbler, and so on", and it''s
    furthermore explained that, if necessary, it can even be used for drinking vessels
    not normally associated with Klingon culture, such as crystal stemware.[2]'
