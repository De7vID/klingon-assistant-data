  hidden_notes: In its first appearance as a noun, in {HQ 4.4, Dec. 1995:src}, {qev:n:nolink}
    was listed as "[a]mong those words already well-known for different types of groups"
    and indicated to be a synonym for {ghom'a':n}. The noun {tlhach:n} was explicitly
    introduced as being a new word in the same article. This suggests that the verb
    {qev:v} was misread as a noun by Marc Okrand when he was preparing the article.
