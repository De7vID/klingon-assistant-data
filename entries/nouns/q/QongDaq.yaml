  hidden_notes: This word may be evidence that at an earlier stage of the language,
    there may have been a noun {Qong:n:nolink} meaning "sleep" or a verb suffix {-Daq:v:suff,nolink}
    meaning "place where one does something", or that a noun {Qong:n:nolink} current
    exists which is unattested elsewhere, but these are just conjectures.[2]
