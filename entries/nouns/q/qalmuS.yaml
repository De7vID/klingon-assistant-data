  notes: Klingon has no word for "color" in the sense of "what color is that?" or
    "red is a nice color". This word is used to distinguish between, for example,
    a color photograph and a black-and-white photograph.[2]
  hidden_notes: 'Herbert Kalmus was the co-founder and President of the Technicolor
    Motion Picture Corporation, and Natalie Kalmus was the color supervisor for many
    of its films.


    On {KGT p.81:src}, it is claimed that there is no noun meaning "color", but this
    is in the sense of a specific color.'
