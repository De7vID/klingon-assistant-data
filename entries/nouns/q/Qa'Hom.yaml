  definition: type of animal (cowardly animal similar to {Qa':n:1} but smaller, mistaken
    for a bird by some)
  notes: 'This literally means "little {Qa'':n:1,nolink}", though a {Qa''Hom:n:nolink}
    is not a young {Qa'':n:1,nolink}, which is a larger, more dangerous animal. However,
    it does bear a vague resemblance. This word is also used as an epithet to denote
    someone who is weak and scared easily, and whom there is no honour in killing.[2]


    This animal does not make a ruckus at dawn, unlike the {jajlo'' Qa'':n}. It is
    mistaken for a bird by some.[3]


    Watch Gowron say this: {YouTube video:url:http://youtu.be/SIpF7Zak6CY}'
  hidden_notes: 'This word appears in the "Curses" section of the {KCD:src} Language
    Lab. In the introduction to the holodeck part of the game, it is used in a derogatory
    manner by Gowron to refer to the player character. Gowron says that there is no
    honour in killing a {Qa''Hom:n:nolink}, but that after the player has finished
    the holodeck adventure, they will no longer be as weak as a {Qa''Hom:n:nolink},
    and then "it will be an honour to kill you".[2]


    The English text in {KCD:src} for this word reads "little animal (e.g., Ligonian
    titmouse)", and it is accompanied by an image of a hedgehog. Presumably, whoever
    selected the image did not realise that a "titmouse" is a kind of bird, and not
    a kind of mouse (which a hedgehog also is not). The audio (which is spoken by
    Marc Okrand) addresses this discrepancy by implying that it resembles a titmouse
    only in its unimportance: "The translation ''titmouse'' is really only an approximation
    of what this word means. A {Qa''Hom:n:nolink} is a small animal considered rather
    insignificant."


    This error is alluded to again in {HQ 10.4:src}, which states some people have
    confused it with a bird for reasons unknown to Maltz. In a personal message to
    {Quvar:n:name} in May 2021, Marc Okrand confirmed that the image is correct and
    that the text is in error, i.e., the {Qa''Hom:n:nolink} resembles a Terran hedgehog.


    Even though {KCD:src} was published before {KGT:src}, the book is listed as the
    first source since it is where the definition comes from.'
