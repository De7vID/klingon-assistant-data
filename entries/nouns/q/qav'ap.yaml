  notes: 'This word is used in {Klingon Monopoly:src} to denote how many {QaS:n:1h}
    a player has to pay when landing on a planet owned by another player.[1]


    It''s not clear what {qav:v:hyp,nolink} means by itself, but it''s possible that
    this was shortened from {qavmeH ''ap:n:nolink} or something like that at some
    point in the past.[2]'
  hidden_notes: '"Cough (it) up".


    No English definition was originally given for this word, so it was given the
    definition "rent, fee" based on usage. The {KLI:src} New Klingon Words list gives
    the definition "rent, cost, price, value". The definition "fee, rent" was confirmed
    at {Saarbrücken qepHom''a'' 2020:src}.'
