  definition: gas produced within the body
  see_also: '{SIp:n}'
  notes: Both this and {ruq:v} can be used for gas that comes up from your gut and
    out of your mouth and also for gas that goes down from your gut and out the other
    way. To distinguish between gases emitted from different orifices, use a phrase
    involving {nuj:n}, {Hugh:n}, or {Sa'Hut:n:1}.[2]
  hidden_notes: 'It sounds like "decrepit".


    This seems to be made up of {Qep:v} "be anxious" and {''It:v} "be depressed",
    but this is probably a coincidence as the words were revealed many years apart.'
