  notes: 'A common way to express lighting or starting a fire is with {chenmoH:v}.
    Another way to express igniting and extinguishing a fire is with {vemmoH:v:0}
    "wake up, cause to wake up" and {QongmoH:v:0} "put to sleep, cause to sleep".
    In the Klingon way of thinking, fire is sort of there all the time, but it''s
    normally sleeping or dormant. Spontaneous combustion would also be described by
    making use of {vem:v}.[2]


    There is no one way to say "firefighter". Some options are {qul SuvwI'':n} "fire
    fighter, fire warrior", {qul qaDwI'':n} "fire challenger", and (though less frequent)
    {qul tlhay''moHwI'':n} "fire tamer". It''s also possible to say {qul QongmoHwI'':n}
    "one who puts fires to sleep", but that''s usually not applied until the fire
    is actually out.[2]'
  hidden_notes: '"Cool" or "coal".'
