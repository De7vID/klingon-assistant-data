  notes: 'This can be used for a certificate or a diploma, but not for a license or
    a permit, which would be a {chaw'':n}. The difference is that a {Qoyje'':n:nolink}
    is proof or verification of some sort of achievement or accomplishment, but it
    doesn''t necessarily allow you to do anything as a result of that.


    Klingons consider title deeds ({yer ghajwI'' chaw'':n}) to be a type of {chaw'':n:nolink},
    rather than a type of {Qoyje'':n:nolink}, since property ownership is granted
    by a government or other authority, but isn''t an accomplishment.'
  hidden_notes: 'Pun: {Qoy:v} "hear" + {je'':v:1} "buy" = "hereby". Many certificates
    begin with "I hereby certify that...".'
