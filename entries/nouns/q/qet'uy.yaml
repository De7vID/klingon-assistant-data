  notes: This grows on certain kinds of trees and looks much like a pine cone as seen
    on Earth. It contains genetic material, so it's similar in function to a pine
    cone as well. This is the proper term, but the term {Sor 'IventoH:n@@Sor:n, 'IventoH:n}
    "tree pineapple" is also heard. The Terran pine cone (or, more generally, conifer
    cone) should be called {tera' qet'uy:n@@tera':n, qet'uy:n}[1] or {tera' qIrqoD
    qet'uy:n@@tera':n, qIrqoD:n, qet'uy:n}.[2]
