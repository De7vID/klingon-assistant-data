  notes: 'This is a "mental and spiritual journey" that a Klingon groom undertakes
    with his closest male friends. It lasts four days and the fasting participants
    are required to endure six trials: deprivation, blood, pain, sacrifice, anguish,
    and death. It has been inaccurately referred to as a "Klingon bachelor party".'
