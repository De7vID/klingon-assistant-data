  notes: 'This word fits into a sentence in the place which would be occupied by the
    answer.[1] It works like a pronoun in questions with "to be" in the English translations.[2]


    Questions in English often map more naturally to imperatives in Klingon. If you
    want to ask a "what" question, consider using a command with a verb such as {ngu'':v}
    instead.[2]  For example, consider {per:v}, {ja'':v}, {Del:v}, etc.


    Also, note that "What are your orders?" is expressed in Klingon as {chay'' jura''?:sen}
    See {chay'':ques}.'
  examples: '

    ▶ {yIH nuq?:sen:nolink} "What is a tribble?"[2]

    ▶ {nuq mI''lIj?:sen}

    ▶ {Dochvam nuq?:sen}

    ▶ {nuq Datlhutlh DaneH?:sen}'
