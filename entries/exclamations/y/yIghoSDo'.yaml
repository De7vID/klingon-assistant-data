  definition: Good luck!
  notes: Since this is not a grammatical sentence, one can only assume that it is
    in some form of {no' Hol:n}. It is recommended to say {Qapla'!:sen} or {povjaj!:excl}
    instead.
  hidden_notes: This ungrammatical expression appears on the back cover of {How to
    Speak Klingon:src}, where it is translated as "Good luck".[1] Even though the
    sentences inside this book were provide by the Klingon Language Institute (see
    {tlhIngan Hol yejHaD:n}) and use proper grammar, it seems that whoever designed
    the cover just copied this erroneous expression from the Internet without verifying
    it with a competent speaker. The originator of this expression is unknown but
    it appeared on some fan websites in 2011, where it is claimed that it literally
    means "Go with fortune".
