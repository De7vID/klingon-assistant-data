  notes: 'This suffix emphasizes that the noun to which it is attached the topic of
    the sentence.[1] It is used with the pronouns to form "to be" constructions.[2]
    It is also used to disambiguate which noun is the head noun in a relative clause
    (see {-bogh:v}).[4]


    If the object noun is marked with {-''e'':n:suff,nolink}, it can come before adverbials,
    which still precede the verb.[3]


    To use {-''e'':n:suff,nolink} on a series of nouns (i.e., nouns joined with one
    of {je:conj}, {joq:conj}, or {ghap:conj}), it must be attached to each noun individually.[4]  This
    can happen if there are multiple head nouns in a relative clause, or if the subject
    of a "to be" construction consists of multiple things.


    In the Morskan dialect (see {mo''rISqa'':n}), this suffix is not used to mark
    the subject in "to be" constructions. If the suffix is used in such a sentence,
    it serves its usual function of emphasis.[5]


    Do not confuse this suffix with the pronoun {''e'':n:pro}.'
