  definition: endearment (noun type 1)
  notes: 'This is a rarely used suffix, which is used to indicate endearment. It is
    usually attached to a word for a relative, or sometimes an animal such as a pet.


    It is suspected that a {qaghwI'':n} is inserted before this suffix if the noun
    ends in a vowel, but no examples are known.'
  hidden_notes: 'In {Star Trek VI:src}, Azetbur was supposed to say {vavwI'':n@@vav:n,
    -wI'':n}. But this was said very softly, and sounded like {vavoy:n:nolink}, leading
    to the creation of this suffix.


    By coincidence, this sounds like the Cantonese word for "love" (愛).'
  examples: '

    ▶ {SoSoy:n}

    ▶ {vavoy:n}'
