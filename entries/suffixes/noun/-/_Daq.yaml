  notes: 'This suffix indicates that an action is occurring (or has occurred or will
    occur) in the vicinity of the noun to which it is attached.[1] It can typically
    be used only for physical locations.[2]


    Some verbs have locative notions in their meanings, and care must be taken when
    using {-Daq:n:suff,nolink} with such verbs. See {ghoS:v:1} and {jaH:v} for more
    details. With verbs of shooting, such as {baH:v} and {bach:v}, {-Daq:n:suff,nolink}
    marks the target.


    When a verb is used adjectivally, this suffix and the other type 5 noun suffixes
    are attached to the verb rather than the noun.'
  hidden_notes: This was influenced by the locative "-tak" in the Mutsun language,
    which Marc Okrand wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on.
