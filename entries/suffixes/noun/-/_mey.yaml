  notes: 'This is the general suffix for a noun which is neither a being capable of
    language nor a body part.


    When this suffix is used for beings capable of using language (instead of {-pu'':n:nolink}),
    it adds the notion of "scattered all about" to the meaning. This suffix cannot
    be used for body parts (see {-Du'':n:nolink}), but this rule is sometimes violated
    by poets.


    Some nouns are inherently plural in meaning, with singular forms which are utterly
    distinct. These inherently plural nouns are treated as grammatically singular,
    in that singular pronouns and verb prefixes are used for them. When the suffix
    {-mey:n:nolink} is applied to the singular forms of these nouns, the resulting
    plural word carries the connotation of "scattered all about".'
  examples: '

    ▶ {yuQmey:n:nolink} "planets"

    ▶ {pu''HIchmey:n:nolink} "phasers"

    ▶ {puqmey:n:nolink} "children all over the place" (cf. {puqpu'':n:nolink})

    ▶ {jatmey:n:nolink} "scattered tongues" (cf. {jatDu'':n:nolink})

    ▶ {DoSmey:n:nolink} "targets scattered all about" (cf. {ray'':n:nolink})'
