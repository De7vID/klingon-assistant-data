  notes: 'This suffix indicates that something that was previously done is now undone,
    or that something is done wrongly. Despite being classified as a rover, this suffix
    occurs immediately after the verb, before any other suffixes.[1]


    This suffix can be applied to some adverbials, but not to all of them.[2; 3] The
    expression {Duj ngaDHa'':n} shows that it can also be applied to verbs used as
    adjectives.[4]'
  hidden_notes: While {-Ha':v:suff,nolink} can mean different things on different
    verbs, it appears to favour a fixed meaning for any particular verb, depending
    on whether the quality or action described by the verb has an opposite or a reversal.
    That meaning is determined by a greater degree of negativity than {-be':v:suff}.
    While this suffix is defined as "undo, do wrongly", most instances of this suffix
    actually denote an opposite rather than an undoing or an erroneous action. See
    {KLI mailing list 2019.03.22:src} for an analysis.
