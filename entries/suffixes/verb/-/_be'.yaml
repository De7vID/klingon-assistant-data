  notes: This follows the concept it negates. It cannot be used to form negative imperatives,
    i.e., it cannot be used to mean "don't" (for which use {-Qo':v} instead)[1; 3].
    However, a command such as {HIleghbe'moH:sen:nolink} is possible.[3; 4] This suffix
    can be applied to verbs used as adjectives.[2]
  hidden_notes: In 2017, it was clarified that {-be':v:suff,nolink} can appear in
    an imperative construction to form a command meaning "do not-X!", and that the
    proscription in {TKD:src} (which says "The suffix {-be':v:suff,nolink} cannot
    be used with imperative verbs") is about when the meaning of the command is "don't
    do X!" (in which case {-Qo':v:suff,nolink} must be used). A shortened, edited
    version of the explanation (without examples) first appeared at {qep'a' 24 (2017):src}.
    A longer version of the explanation was subsequently included in the {Saarbrücken
    qepHom'a' 2017:src} booklet, which is where the example sentence {HIleghbe'moH:sen:nolink}
    appears.
