  notes: 'This word is used for something that incrementally or gradually (not necessarily
    slowly) goes away, such as food on one''s plate or dirt that one washes off of
    something.[2]


    If a room is filled with boxes that are to be taken somewhere, and then over a
    short or long time, the boxes are removed, then {loj:v:nolink} could be used once
    there are no more boxes. If a room was full of furniture, and a person left the
    room and came back to find the room empty (and there was no reason to expect this
    to happen), then {ngab:v} might be used.[2]


    This word would be appropriate to describe what happens to someone who beams away,
    if one is focusing on the incremental disappearance of the person. Once the person
    is gone, {ngab:v:nolink} might be used. People who are watching someone beam away
    might use {DemchoH:v@@Dem:v, -choH:v} to describe what they are seeing.[2]'
