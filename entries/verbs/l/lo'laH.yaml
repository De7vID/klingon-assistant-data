  see_also: '{Qej:v}, {lI'':v:1}'
  notes: This is a simple verb in its own right, and not the verb {lo':v} with the
    suffix {-laH:v}. It's likely that there is a historical connection to the verb
    plus suffix form.[2]
  hidden_notes: In Section 4.2.9 of {TKDA:src}, the explanation of {-ghach:v:suff}
    clearly implies that {lo'laH:v:nolink} is the verb {lo':v:nolink} plus the suffix
    {-laH:v:nolink}. However, the verb {lo':v:nolink} with the suffix {-laH:v:nolink}
    does not produce the meaning "be valuable". It's likely that {lo':v:nolink} and
    {lI':v:1} were mixed up while {TKD:src} was being written, as {lI'laHbe':v@@lI':v:1,
    -laH:v, -be':v} "cannot be useful" is basically synonymous with "be worthless",
    which appears as {lo'laHbe':v} in the {TKD:src} word list. Consequently, Section
    4.2.9 of {TKDA:src} and the {msn:src} newsgroup message are somewhat contradictory.
