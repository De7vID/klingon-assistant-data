  notes: 'This describes the back-and-forth motion of something fixed at one end to
    a pivot. When applied to a person, it means the feet stay put on the ground while
    the body leans left and right.[1] The pivot could be at the top, bottom, or somewhere
    else. A rhythmic oscillation like that of a pendulum would be {lerchu'':v}.[2]


    For motion around a pivot in one direction only, which comes to a stop, see {lav:v}.[2]


    For movement to the side without rotation or being fixed to a point, see {Dav:v:1}.'
