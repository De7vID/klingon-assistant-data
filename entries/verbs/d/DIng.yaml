  definition: spin
  notes: This is generally used for things spinning or rotating continuously or for
    a long time, while {jIr:v} is used when the thing rotates partially or once or
    for a few times. For example, one would {jIrmoH:v:2} the steering wheel of a car,
    while the tires {DIng:v:nolink}.[2]
  hidden_notes: MO implied at {Saarbrücken qepHom'a' 2011:src} that {DIng:v:nolink}
    is intransitive by saying that it works in the same way as {jIr:v:nolink}, but
    did not elaborate on the exact difference between the two verbs. The clarification
    was later provided in a message to the mailing list in 2021, which also confirmed
    that it is intransitive.[2]
