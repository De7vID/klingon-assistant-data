  notes: 'This is used for leaking liquid, gas, or things like sand. The subject is
    the thing that has the hole or crack (or whatever) in it, and the object is what
    is leaking out of it. The object is often omitted.[1]


    When the substance which is leaking is the subject, use {ghIt:v} or, if the leak
    is slow or relatively minor, use {bol:v:1}.[1]


    A leak of information would be expressed using {''otHa'':v}, as in {chIch ''otHa'':sen@@chIch:adv,
    ''otHa'':v}.[1]'
  examples: '
