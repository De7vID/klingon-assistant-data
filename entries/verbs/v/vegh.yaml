  definition: go through an existing opening (an open door, a tunnel, etc.)
  see_also: '{chob:n}, {''och:n}, {lojmIt:n}, {tol:v}, {''aw:v}'
  notes: 'This verb only means to go through an opening of some sort, and not "to
    traverse" (in the sense of "going through" a forest).[1] The object is the thing
    being gone through. {-Daq:n:suff} is unnecessary.[2]


    For {vegh:v:nolink} to be applicable, the object must completely encircle the
    vector of travel, so it would not apply to a bridge unless it was covered over.
    But this need not be exact, in that a meshwork or cage-like object would count.[5]
    If one wanders around in a tunnel, it would not be {vegh:v:nolink}, and conversely,
    if a tunnel-like covered path goes through a forest, {vegh:v:nolink} might be
    applicable.[6]'
  hidden_notes: 'This was the word awarded to the winning team at a contest during
    {qep''a'' 4 (1997):src}. The requested word was "go through", and four example
    sentences were provided to MO to clarify the meaning: "the bullet goes through
    the man''s heart", "the hunter goes through the forest", "the train goes through
    the tunnel", and "the bird goes through the [open] window". MO noted that these
    were three different concepts, with the latter two sentences illustrating the
    same idea, which is expressed by {vegh:v:nolink}.[1]


    This is defined as "go through (an open door, a tunnel, etc.)" in the KLI new
    words list. However, other attendees wrote down different definitions, such as
    "go through (an existing aperture)".[1; 2]


    In the chapter where the sentence {ghe''tor vegh Duj:sen:nolink} appears, the
    Barge of the Dead goes through Gre''thor as if it were merely an opening into
    Sto-vo-kor, which is why {vegh:v:nolink} is appropriate.[6]'
