  notes: For "tackle," combine with {pummoH:v@@pum:v:2, -moH:v} "cause to fall (down)".
  hidden_notes: 'The requested word was "tackle", defined as "seize and knock to the
    ground".


    It was stated during the Q & A session that the primary meaning of this word is
    physical (i.e., it does not mean "wrestling" with a problem). The object is the
    person being grappled, but MO would have to think about whether it can be a body
    part.'
