  notes: 'This would be used if something flipped all the way over on its own accord
    or seemingly on its own accord (even if there is a known cause). If it was flipped
    over by something else, see {yoymoH:v}. If it was tipped over but not completely
    flipped, see {qaw'':v}.


    If one flipped over in bed, one would normally say {jItach:sen@@jI-:v, tach:v}.
    One could say {jItach''eghmoH:sen@@jI-:v, tach:v, -''egh:v, -moH:v} if there were
    a particular struggle or effort involved.


    One is more likely to use {tachmoH:v@@tach:v, -moH:v} than {yoymoH:v:nolink} when
    moving someone from a prone to a supine position (or vice versa). One is more
    likely to use {yoymoH:v:nolink} than {tachmoH:v:nolink} when flipping hamburgers
    or pancakes. Either would be fine for flipping over cards, with {yoymoH:v:nolink}
    implying a quicker or crisper action.'
