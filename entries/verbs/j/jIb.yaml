  hidden_notes: 'Maltz thought maybe an early form of torture or execution was hanging
    people by their hair, but he wasn''t sure about this and may have just been reacting
    to the homophony.


    A "gibbet" is a structure used for public execution. It''s also a term for the
    projecting arm of a crane, another word for which is the "jib".'
