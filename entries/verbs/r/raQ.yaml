  notes: 'This can be applied to the arts, weapons, or spaceships. It refers to any
    activity which involves having some control over some object. In the context of
    swords, it can be used with a similar meaning to {yan:v}. In the context of spaceships
    (see {Duj:n:1}), this refers to controlling a vessel "manually", rather than by
    computer.[1, p.79]


    In contrast to {ruQ:v:nolink}, which is more likely to be used when the handling
    alters the configuration of the thing being manipulated, {raQ:v:nolink} is used
    when the thing being handled doesn''t do anything if it''s not being handled.
    {raQ:v:nolink} is used when manually controlling a spaceship using switches or
    buttons and so on, as opposed to letting the computer control things automatically.
    But {ruQ:v:nolink} would be used if someone is manually controlling the thrusters
    by physically doing something to them directly, like yanking a thruster component,
    or twisting something, or banging on something.[2]'
