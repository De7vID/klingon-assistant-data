  notes: This refers to controlling or handling something that can or may do something
    on its own (or due to some source of power), but the manual intervention causes
    it to do something else or behave differently. It is more likely to be used when
    the handling alters the configuration of the thing being manipulated, in comparison
    to {raQ:v:nolink} (which is used if the thing being handled doesn't do anything
    if it's not being handled). One might {ruQ:v:nolink} a robot vacuum cleaner by
    picking it up and reorienting it. One would not {ruQ:v:nolink} a {betleH:n} (unless
    it's an adjustable {betleH:n:nolink} of some sort). If one were to {ruQ:v:nolink}
    a work of art, that would suggest the artwork is manipulable in some way. Controlling
    the thrusters by pushing a button or two would be {raQ:v:nolink}, but manually
    controlling them by physically doing something to them directly, like yanking
    a thruster component, twisting something, or banging on something, would be {ruQ:v:nolink}.[2]
