  notes: 'This implies bulk due to body fat or the like, while {pI'':v} does not have
    this connotation. Both can be used to express "not thin", but {ror:v:nolink} is
    more appropriate to convey "not lean". When this verb is used to describe an inanimate
    object, there is usually a bit of anthropomorphizing, likening the object to a
    person or an animal.[2]


    A "fat book" would be a {paq qargh:n@@paq:n:1, qargh:v}, unless the book comes
    to life as a character in a cartoon or something like that. (In that case, the
    plural suffix {-pu'':n:suff} might also be expected.)[2]'
  hidden_notes: This was defined as just "be fat" in {TKD:src}. The clarification
    was added at {Saarbrücken qepHom'a' 2019:src}.
