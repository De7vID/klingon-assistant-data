  notes: This word is used to describe the design of a physical object of some sort;
    it would not be used in the sense of making a plan to do something (which would
    be {nab:v}). It differs from {'ogh:v}, which implies the creation of something
    which has not been created before.
  hidden_notes: Christopher Wren and James Renwick, Jr., were the names of two famous
    architects.
