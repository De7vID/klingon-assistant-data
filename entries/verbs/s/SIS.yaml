    The sentence {chaHDaq SIStaHvIS negh ''Iw:sen:nolink} "[While they were] showered
    with the soldiers'' blood" appeared in {paq''batlh 1ed p.136-137:src}, but this
    sentence was replaced in the 2ed with one which uses {ghay:v:nolink} instead.


    At {qep''a'' 30 (2023):src}, it was confirmed that the subject of {SIS:v:nolink}
    (and other weather words) was the thing that generated the weather: clouds, the
    atmosphere, and the ceiling were all good subjects. In particular, {SIS pa''beb:sen:nolink}
    "the ceiling rained" could be used for a leaking ceiling.[3]'
