  see_also: '{qen:v}'
  notes: This means to move one object while it maintains contact with another object
    or over some area, with pressure and friction. The object is the surface being
    rubbed. If something is used to do the rubbing (like a cloth), the verb {lo':v}
    is used with that as the object. If something is rubbed away, use the verb {bI':v}
    with that as its object. This verb is not used for grating cheese (in the sense
    of by moving it back and forth against a grater).[1]
