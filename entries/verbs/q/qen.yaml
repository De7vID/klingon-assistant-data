  notes: This means to move an object over something while maintaining contact, with
    the intention of removing some substance from the surface. The object is the surface
    being wiped. If something is used to do the wiping, the verb {lo':v} is used with
    it as the object. If something is wiped away, the verb {bI':v} is used with that
    as the object.[1]
