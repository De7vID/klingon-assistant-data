  notes: This would be used if something tipped over on its own accord or seemingly
    on its own accord (even if there is a known cause). For example, this would be
    used if one lost one's balance. For "flip (all the way) over", see {yoymoH:v}
    and {tach:v}.[2]
  hidden_notes: '"Cow tipping" is an urban legend about the activity of pushing over
    a cow for entertainment.


    This was first defined as "flip over", but it was revealed in answer to a question
    about cars being overturned in the street, a chair or big box being kicked over,
    or a drinking glass or anything else falling over from a vertical into a horizontal
    position.[1] It was later clarified that "tip over" is a better definition.[2]


    This is confirmed as intransitive since {qaw''moH:v} was also glossed as "make
    something flip over".[1]'
