  hidden_notes: 'It is unclear if this means "to tire someone out" (see {Doy'':v}),
    "to use something up completely" (see {natlh:v:1}), or (as in English) both.


    Previously, some people believed that this word means "to expel exhaust", based
    on its similarity to {tlhuH:v:1}, and that {ghImwI'':n:nolink} was a mistake for
    {tlhuchwI'':n:nolink}. See the KLI Round Table in {HQ 11.2, p.10, Jun. 2002:src}.
    However, further information on {ghIm:v} since then have confirmed that {ghImwI'':n:nolink}
    is correct.'
