  notes: 'While {mej:v:nolink} refers simply to leaving one''s current location, {tlheD:v}
    generally implies setting out on a journey, with a goal or destination in mind.
    In both cases, the object is the place you''re leaving or departing from.[3]


    The suffix {-vo'':n:suff} (with the no-object prefix) is used when the place that
    one is leaving is a starting point. Without the suffix (and with the prefix indicating
    an object), it simply means that one is no longer at a place they''ve been. It''s
    also possible to have both a starting point marked with {-vo''} and a place as
    the object, in which case one is leaving the place from that starting point.[5]


    If a Klingon had to say "goodbye", they might say {DaH jImej:sen@@DaH:adv, jI-:v,
    mej:v}, literally "I''m leaving now".[2] Of course, in most situations a Klingon
    would just leave, without superfluous niceties such as declaring his or her intention
    to do so.


    This would not normally be used of an inanimate object, for which see {ngab:v}
    (or {loj:v} if something goes away gradually).[4]


    To express leaving a person or object (rather than a location), consider {lon:v}.'
  hidden_notes: 'The {TNK:src} software forces all languages to follow a template,
    which includes expressions such as "hello", "goodbye", and colour words which
    don''t have a natural translation in Klingon.


    There are situations in which a Klingon might actually say {DaH jImej:sen:nolink}.
    See the examples under {ghIm:v} and {qIvon belmoH:sen}.


    The example sentences from the mailing list came out of a discussion about revisions
    to the {paq''batlh:src}.'
  examples: '

    ▶ {bIghHa'' DamejDI'' pagh QaS yInob.:sen}

    ▶ {chalqachlIjvo'' bImej:sen:nolink} (you leave, with your tower as a starting
    point)[5]

    ▶ {chalqachlIj Damej:sen:nolink} (you leave your tower, where you had previously
    been)[5]

    ▶ {lojmItmeyvo'' ghe''tor Damejta'':sen:nolink} (you left Gre''thor from the gates)[5]'
