  hidden_notes: This sentence was one of the most significant in the development of
    the Klingon language. It was originally supposed to mean "I told you, engines
    only." It was changed in the subtitles to say "I wanted prisoners." This led to
    the invention of the plural suffix for beings {-pu':n}, the accomplishment suffix
    {-ta':v}, the verbs {jon:v} and {neH:v}, and the idea of clipped Klingon which
    was needed to explain their lack of any prefix, the rule that the second verb
    in a sentence-as-object construction never takes an aspect suffix, as well as
    a change in the meaning of the verb {ma':v} to mean "accommodate" (its original
    meaning being assigned to the new verb {ja':v}). Furthermore, {QuQ:n} was changed
    from a verb meaning "to disable" to a noun meaning "engine" for the line, {baHwI',
    DoS yIbuS. QuQ neH.:sen}
  components: '{qama'':n}, {-pu'':n}, {jon:v}, {-ta'':v}, {neH:v}'
