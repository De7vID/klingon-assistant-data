  notes: "These lines about Kahless were repeated in several episodes of {Star Trek\
    \ Discovery:src} (with minor variations, see below).\n\n▶ {'Iv wInej?:sen@@'Iv:ques:1h,\
    \ wI-:v, nej:v}\n  \"Whom do we seek?\"\n\n▶ {qeylIS.:sen@@qeylIS:n}\n  \"Kahless.\"\
    \n\n▶ {chay' wISam?:sen@@chay':ques, wI-:v, Sam:v}\n  \"How do we find him?\"\n\
    \n▶ {matay'taHvIS.:sen@@ma-:v, tay':v, -taH:v, -vIS:v}\n  \"Together.\"\n\n▶ {qeylIS,\
    \ maleghmeH yIwovmoH.:sen@@qeylIS:n:name, ma-:v, legh:v, -meH:v, yI-:v, wov:v,\
    \ -moH:v}\n  \"Kahless, give us light to see.\"\n\n▶ {reH.:sen@@reH:adv}\n  \"\
    Forever.\"\n\n▶ {wInejtaHvIS reH So''egh'a'?:sen@@wI-:v, nej:v, -taH:v, -vIS:v,\
    \ reH:adv, So':v:1, -'egh:v, -'a':v}\n  \"Will he hide from us always?\"\n\n▶\
    \ {not.:sen@@not:adv}\n  \"Never.\"\n\nThese sentences were used by {lIr'el:n:name}\
    \ to activate {voq:n:name}.[2]\n\nThe last words of {tIquvma:n:name} before he\
    \ died were a version of these lines, which he referred to as \"the words we said\
    \ as children in Kahless' honor\". This version has the line {jIjaHmeH yIwovmoH:sen@@jI-:v,\
    \ jaH:v, -meH:v, yI-:v, wov:v, -moH:v}, instead of {qeylIS, maleghmeH yIwovmoH.:sen:nolink}.[1]\
    \ When Ash Tyler was sentenced to death, he alluded to these lines by saying {qeylIS,\
    \ jIleghmeH yIwovmoH. reH.:sen@@qeylIS:n:name, jI-:v, legh:v, -meH:v, yI-:v, wov:v,\
    \ -moH:v, reH:adv} \"Give me light to see, forever.\"[3] It seems that this sentence\
    \ can be adapted by the speaker for the specific occasion."
  hidden_notes: 'These lines were not given a name within the show, but some have
    referred to it online as "the Kahless prayer" or "the prayer to Kahless".


    Even though the line spoken by {tIquvma:n:name} means "Give me light to go", it
    was still subtitled in English as "Give us light to see". This is probably a production
    error.'
